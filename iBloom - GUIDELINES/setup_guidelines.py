Burnout Clinical Guidelines

ESSENTIALS
Burnout is not an illness but a syndrome. It should not be medicalized.
The three key features of burnout are:
- Intense, overwhelming fatigue
- Cynical relationship to work  
- Diminished professional self-esteem

Depression and burnout overlap. Burnout may be a precipitating factor in the development depression. 
Depression is actively treated as in other cases. Fatigue may be the symptom of a somatic disease.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Burnout does not appear overnight. Instead, it develops gradually through the interaction of one's 
personality, work and work community. Burnout is not the same as work stress. Stress is created when 
a person tries to adapt to his or her workload, and it is not entirely negative. Burnout develops when 
mere adaptation does not suffice, normalization is not achieved, and the state of stress is prolonged.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Common psychiatric differential diagnoses:
- Severe depression (especially when feelings of worthlessness or guilt are associated)
- Alcohol and drug abuse problem (for example, recurring short absence from work)
- Atypical depression (for example, getting emotionally hurt at workplace triggers strong fluctuations in mood)
- Stress disorders (a distinct external triggering factor must be identified)
- Generalized anxiety disorder (worry over one's performance, constant restlessness)
- Fear of social situations (fatigue in social situations)
- Somatization disorder (several somatic symptoms)
- Personality disorder (functioning may vary, but problems have continued throughout adulthood)
- Adjustment disorders (identifiable external stress factor that impairs functioning unexpectedly)

TREATMENT
Speaking about "treatment" may cause unnecessary medicalization of the problem. It would be better to talk 
about rehabilitation or empowerment to manage one's own affairs. Job modification is among the most 
important means in this.

The amount and perceived loading of work tasks can be influenced by interventions directed at the work 
place and well-being at work. Interventions targeting the work place may often decrease the time required 
for return to work.

Part of the rehabilitation consists of an individual assessment of what has caused the burnout, where it 
has led to and how the situation can be resolved.

If burnout is manifested as a part of depression or an adjustment disorder, the need of treatment and 
sick leave are determined on terms generally applicable in these disorders, albeit the role of job 
modification is more important.

Severe fatigue impairing functional capacity e.g. in association with an adjustment disorder requires 
a sick leave of 2‚Äì3 weeks.

A severe state of depression often requires even longer sick leave because it takes longer to regain 
functional capacity than it does for symptoms to disappear.

If the patient has burnout without a psychiatric or somatic illness and he/she needs time off work, 
the solution is not a sick leave but a reduction of work burden or other arrangements of work tasks.

PREVENTION
Burnout can be prevented by:
- Making clear the difference between work and leisure time
- The ability to say "no", i.e. bold prioritization of tasks
- The ability to plan one's work in advance
- Taking care of one's physical condition
- Admitting one's own limits
- Good relationships at home
- Working relationships at work
- An open work climate
- Consistent career development
- A supportive employer
- Clear definitions of work assignments
- Perception of one's job as meaningful
- Inclusion of field-level workers in work development activities
- Maintenance of expertise

Work supervision may prevent burnout of at least health care and teaching personnel.
